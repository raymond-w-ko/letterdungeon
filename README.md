# letterdungeon
A roguelike dungeon game for VR, staying true to the original visually.

## Design Decisions
Basically deciding what type of game this is.
* Turn based.
* Uses letters to represent the floor, monsters, walls (like the original rogue and angband).
 * Easy to create assets as I am not a 3D artist.
 * Hopefully balanced by having crazy fancy shader effects for coolness.
